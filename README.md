Hello, this repository contains many different parts, the indoor green house is currently a 4 foot 
by 4 foot enclosed tent. Inside of the green house (refered to as the grow tent) there are reflective 
kevlar siding to ensure light is not wasted rather it is directed towards the plants themself.

The grow tent is currently on version 1.1.

Grow tent 1.0 was rather rudimentary. It grew an unidentified but supposedly hardy strain of cannabis.
For 1.0 the location of growing was in Massachusetts in 2021, meaning it was fully compliant with 
local laws. It grew 4 plants, but unfortunately only one was able to grow fully. Grow tent 1.0 used
a system called "deep water" hydroponics, which is were the roots are left to soak in a nutrient
solution continuously.
Grow tent 1.0 had the following problems that ultimately led to a reduced and sickly harvest:
1. The roots were constantly at risk of developing root rot, this killed 2 plants.
2. There was not enough nutrient, this caused the living plant to be very small and sickly.
3. The root rot allowed for many diseases to fester, this led to 1 other plant to die.

Grow tent 1.1 tries to solve these problems by addressing the major problems of root rot and 
nutrient deficiencies.
The grow tent still soaks the roots, but only for a prescribed amount of time. The roots soak
for about 15 minutes and then dry for about 40-45 minutes.
