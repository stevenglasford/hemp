On 7-21-2022 I built a new system that I could potentially market
as a kit. These are the notes associated with such system.
Save for the blueprints which will be added to the github in due time.

system goes live.
Four bins converted into a recirculating water supply system.

Water doesn't drain as good as I had expected.
Currently using a 1/4 inch drain tubing, most of the sunflower seeds are
floating in the water (they should just be touching the water).
Remedy: increase water drain flow by increasing diameter of drain OR
        increase number of bins per motor
Also must be noted:
	-Most of the bins have some sort of mold growing on the sunflower seeds
	-There is also a white froth that is beginning to form in most bins.
	-Most of the seeds are starting to sprout meaning the sunflower bird 
	 bird seeds are the best canidate for a model species.

	Remedy for the mold: clean seeds before putting them into system
		many were dirty before placing them into the system.
	Watch for the increase of froth and mold in the system in the next
		couple of days.
